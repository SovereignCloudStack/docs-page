## About

The Sovereign Cloud Stack combines the best of Cloud Computing in one unified standard.
SCS is built, backed, and operated by an active open-source community worldwide.
As only the sum of different repositories complete the SCS Stack, it is important to have an easy and accessible documentation in one place.
