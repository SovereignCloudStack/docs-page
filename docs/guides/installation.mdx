## Installation Guide

### Step 1 – Installing Node.js via nvm

It is recommended to install Node.js via nvm – a node version manager – having the possibility to switch between node.js versions.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

You must have macOS desktop access with administrator privileges.

Login to the macOS desktop system and [install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on your system (if not already installed).

Install command:

```
brew install nvm
```

If you have no other projects, where you need a different version, it is recommended to install the latest stable LTS version of node.

```console
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

See [this](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) installation guide on GitHub by nvm-sh for installing nvm.

```console
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

If your terminal shows the lts version number then everything is set up correctly and you can continue.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

[NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
runs in an Admin shell. You'll need to start powershell or Command Prompt as Administrator to use nvm-windows. Install it with an Installer provided by nvm-sh on their [release page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases). You can check the available versions with

```console
nvm list
```

If you have no other projects, where you need a different version, it is recommended to install the latest stable LTS version of node.

```console
nvm install lts
nvm use lts
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

nvm has now installed the latest node.js version with its package manager npm. Check if the installation has been successfull by checking it:

```console
node --version
```

### Step 2 – Cloning the repository

Clone the [docs-page](https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page) repository via your favourite method:

<Tabs groupId="cloning-">
  <TabItem value="https" label="HTTPS">

```console title="HTTPS"
git clone https://github.com/SovereignCloudStack/docs-page.git
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ssh" label="SSH">

```console title="SSH"
git clone git@github.com:SovereignCloudStack/docs-page.git
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3 – Installing dependencies

Change your working directory within your terminal to the root of the cloned repository `/docs-page` and install all dependencies:

```console
npm install
```

### Step 4 – Starting the development server

You can now run the local development server from your terminal:

```console
npm start
```

Once the server is up and running, your terminal will show you the local URL which you can open with your browser to see the page.
